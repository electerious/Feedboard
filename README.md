## üëã Introduction

Feedboard is a small web app that lets you plan and design a photo feed (e.g. for Instagram). Add you local photos without uploading them to a server and find the ones that look great together.

- **Beautiful**: Minimal and focused interface
- **Privacy focused**: Photos stay in your browser and will never be uploaded to a server
- **Web based**: No app, no login, no bullshit. Just a website you can instantly use.
- **Open source**: Use the website or host it yourself

## üöÄ Get started

Either [use the website](https://feedboard.vercel.app) or install and host the Feedboard yourself.

```
git clone https://github.com/electerious/Feedboard.git
cd Feedboard
yarn
yarn dev
```
